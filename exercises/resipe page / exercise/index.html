        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>CINNAMON SUGAR MIXTURE</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <p>CHURRO BATTER</p>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <p>    
        <hr2>OPTIONAL DIPPING SAUCES</h2>
        </p>
            <ul>caramel sauce</ul>
            <ul>chocolate sauce</ul>
            <ul>sweetened condensed milk</ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together sugar and 
            cinnamon to make the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a pot, add water, sugar, vanilla extract, 
            pumpkin puree, unsalted butter, and salt.</li>
            <li>Set over medium-high heat and whisk together.</li>
            <lil>Once it comes to a boil, drop the heat to low and add
            the flour. Use a rubber spatula to mix together until 
            there are no more clumps of flour left, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take off the heat and allow to cool for 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add one egg and mix using a rubber spatula or in a 
            stand mixer until fully incorporated. Add the second 
            egg and mix again until fully incorporated. The dough
            should be firm, elastic and just a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>Transfer into a piping bag fitted with a tip.</li>
            <li>Cut parchment paper into small squares. Spray with
            oil and pipe pumpkins out onto each square. You
            may need to use scissors to cut the stem off at 
            the end.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 325°F and drop one heart in at a time,
            making sure to move slowly so it drops into the oil
            smoothly. Allow it to get golden brown on one side 
            before flipping over. Once it’s golden on both sides,
            transfer to a paper towel to drain excess oil. Repeat
            until all the churros are fried.</li>
            <li>Coat the churros in the cinnamon sugar mixture.</li>
            <li>Enjoy with some caramel or chocolate sauce!</li>
        </ul>
