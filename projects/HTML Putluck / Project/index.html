        <p>Craving a refreshing treat without the 
           fuss? This sorbet recipe is so simple, 
           you'll only need two ingredients. No ice
           cream maker needed! Just cherries and 
           limes come together in a burst of flavor
           that's perfect for summer.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Ingredient List</b>
        <ul>2 cups sweet cherries</ul>
        <ul>2 limes</ul>
        <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
        <p>
        <ol>Remove the stems and pits of cherries.</ol>
        <ol>Place cherries on a parchment lined 
            baking sheet. Spread evenly. Place 
            in freezer for 2-3 hours. Once cherries
            are frozen transfer into an airtight 
            freezer bag or container and leave in
             freezer overnight.
        </ol>
        <ol>When ready to enjoy sorbet, take the 
            frozen cherries and place in a food 
            processor. Juice the 2 limes on top of
            the cherries. Pulse to blend cherries 
            into desired sorbet consistency. You 
            may need to scrape down the sides 
            occasionally to ensure even blending.
        </ol>
        <ol>Serve immediately for a soft-serve-like
            consistency. If you prefer a harder
            sorbet, place in an airtight container 
            and put in the freezer until desired
            consistency is reached.
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recipe Notes:</b></p>
        <p>
        <ul>No cherry pitter? No problem! Use a
            metal straw to make quick work of those pits.
        </ul>
        <ul>Keep extra frozen cherries on hand for 
            instant sorbet anytime.
        </ul>
