                Hi, I'm Millie! I have been waiting for 
                you to find me. I am the one you have 
                been looking for. I am very playful 
                and gentle. I use the doggie door and 
                puppy pads for potty training. You can 
                take me anywhere because I am very 
                socialized with loud noises and large 
                and small animals. I also like cats. I 
                can go anywhere you go. I can sleep 
                right by your side. I am your best 
                buddy. I will come home all healthy 
                to you, up to date on my puppy 
                vaccinations, health certificate, 
                vet checkups, registration pedigree 
                certificate, and my own microchip. I
                am waiting for you.
            </p>
