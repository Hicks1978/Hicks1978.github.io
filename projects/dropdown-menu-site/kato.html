                Hi there! My name is Vixen! Are you 
                looking for someone to spend this 
                holiday and forever with? Well, 
                look no further. I would be thrilled 
                to! Imagine how much fun we could have 
                together! We could build a snowman, go 
                Christmas caroling, and make delicious 
                Christmas candy treats! On winter evenings, 
                while the snow is blowing outside, we can 
                cuddle by the warm fireplace, while you 
                sip hot chocolate, and talk about the 
                exciting adventures of the day! I am 
                ready to spend forever with you! I have 
                incredible parents! My father is extremely 
                handsome, very intelligent, and super social! 
                My mother is extremely beautiful, super loyal, 
                and shows lots of pride! I will come home vet 
                checked and up-to-date on vaccinations! I 
                am already microchipped! I am excited to meet you!
            </p>
