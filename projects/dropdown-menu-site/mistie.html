                Hi, I'm Mistie, and I love to play! Everyone 
                always tells me how beautiful I am! I always 
                get happy and excited when you are ready to 
                play because that's what I live for! My 
                parents are both built very beautifully, so 
                I'm hoping to look just like them when I 
                grow up! I love attention and meeting new 
                people, but being your companion is my 
                number one goal! I promise to always love 
                you and be the light of your life! I will come 
                to you with my vaccinations up to date, so I will
                be healthy and happy. Pick me! I'm super excited 
                to meet you!
            </p>
